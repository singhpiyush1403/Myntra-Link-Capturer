# Myntra-Link-Capturer
This Selenium automation project captures all hyperlinks from the Myntra website. It navigates to Myntra, extracts every &lt;a> tag, and prints the link texts. The script demonstrates the use of findElements and implicit waits in Selenium. A useful example for learning how to scrape or analyze links from a webpage.
